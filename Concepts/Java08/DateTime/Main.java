/*
 * Why do we even needed the new and updated Time Class ?
 *  - Previously, one was mutable and time can be changed after some operations and was a really big
 *    issue so there was always one tension that we have to make sure that it should be not changed.
 *    Now, Updated ones are immutable 
 * 
 *  - It was really confusing and the new ones are very well designed easy to use and flexible.
 * 
 *  - Limited Functionality for zone and time difference.
