    Java Inner Classes 


     - Needs for Java Inner Classes :
      *  Adding specific functionalities to the outer class without exposing them to the rest of the program.
      *  Keeping a class private by hiding it from other parts of the program.
      *  Grouping related classes together for better organization.
      *  Allowing access to the outer class's private members.
      *  Improving code readability and maintainability.
      *  Provide specific functionalities as helper classes or event handlers.
      *  Manage scope and namespaces effectively to avoid name conflicts.


     - Advantages 
      *  Can use private stuff from the outer class (methods & variables).
      *  Help keep the code neat and tidy.
      *  Make coding easier and quicker.
      *  Allow you to hide some code from other parts of your program.
      *  Help keep related classes together.
      *  Make the code easier to read and maintain.
      *  Add extra features to the outer class.
